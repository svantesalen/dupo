/**
 * Main package for the dupo application.
 * 
 * The application is a small hack I made that can identify folders with same contents:
 * <ol>
 * <li>User selects a number of folders to analyze.</li>
 * <li>The application goes through all selected folders and their sub-folders.</li>
 * <li>All duplicate folders (or sub-folders) are presented to the user.</li>
 * </ol>
